# Drivers
This section lists the interfaces that each driver type exposes, as well as the ComputerCraft peripheral types that map to the type with driver names.

The events listed on each page are only sent when a process requests them through the [`devlisten` syscall](syscalls/hardware.html#devlistendevice-string-state-boolean--true).

Note: Method lists do not include the corresponding `get`/`set` methods for properties.
