Description: SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2 and BLAKE3 functions written in pure Lua and optimized for speed.
 This module contains functions to calculate SHA digest:
    MD5, SHA-1,
    SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256, SHA-384, SHA-512,
    SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SHAKE128, SHAKE256,
    HMAC,
    BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, BLAKE2bp, BLAKE2sp, BLAKE2Xb, BLAKE2Xs,
    BLAKE3, BLAKE3_KDF
 Written in pure Lua.
 Compatible with:
    Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, Lua 5.4, Fengari, LuaJIT 2.0/2.1 (any CPU endianness).
 Main feature of this module: it was heavily optimized for speed.
 For every Lua version the module contains particular implementation branch to get benefits from version-specific features.
    - branch for Lua 5.1 (emulating bitwise operators using look-up table)
    - branch for Lua 5.2 (using bit32/bit library), suitable for both Lua 5.2 with native "bit32" and Lua 5.1 with external library "bit"
    - branch for Lua 5.3/5.4 (using native 64-bit bitwise operators)
    - branch for Lua 5.3/5.4 (using native 32-bit bitwise operators) for Lua built with LUA_INT_TYPE=LUA_INT_INT
    - branch for LuaJIT without FFI library (useful in a sandboxed environment)
    - branch for LuaJIT x86 without FFI library (LuaJIT x86 has oddity because of lack of CPU registers)
    - branch for LuaJIT 2.0 with FFI library (bit.* functions work only with Lua numbers)
    - branch for LuaJIT 2.1 with FFI library (bit.* functions can work with "int64_t" arguments)
