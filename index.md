# Phoenix

Welcome to the home page for the Phoenix operating system.

Phoenix is the next-generation modular operating system for ComputerCraft. It introduces a brand-new way to interact with CC, adding many services from modern systems such as preemptive multitasking, filesystem permissions, virtual device trees, and much more. Phoenix entirely replaces CraftOS, giving programs a clean slate free from the legacy APIs and odd syntaxes that plague CraftOS, while still providing the same ease of use as CraftOS's APIs. In addition, it includes a graphical user interface with support for rich applications, allowing a full desktop OS experience inside ComputerCraft.

This site is home to the following first-party components of the default Phoenix distribution:
- Phoenix kernel
- pxboot bootloader
- libsystem library
- libcraftos library
- baseutils program package
- coresvc service package
- startd init system
- Swift/PhoenixWM window manager

**This site is a work-in-progress.** All information listed here is *pre-release* info, and may be subject to change at any time. It may also be inaccurate with the current state of Phoenix.
